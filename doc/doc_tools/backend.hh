/** @mainpage MAUS: MICE Analysis User Software - Backend

Welcome to the MAUS backend code documentation.  This documentation documents the code within the MAUS backend rather than explaining how to use the code.  If you want tutorials, documents explaining the structure of MAUS, or anything other than how classes and functions operation then you should consult the Wiki link above.

These pages are made hourly by running <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a>.  To learn how to write comments within MAUS such that <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a>  picks then up you can either see the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a>  homepage or look at other sources files within MAUS.
